//Q3. Write a program called GradesAverage, which prompts user for the number of students, reads it
//from the keyboard, and saves it in an int variable called numStudents. It then prompts user for the 
//grades of each of the students and saves them in an int array called grades. Your program shall 
//check that the grade is between 0 and 100. A sample session is as follow:
//Enter the number of students: 3
//Enter the grade for student 1: 55
//Enter the grade for student 2: 108
//Invalid grade, try again...
//Enter the grade for student 2: 56
//Enter the grade for student 3: 57
//The average is: 56.0
